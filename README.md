# Project: Coarse to fine K nearest neighbor classifier
Coarse to Fine K Nearest Neighbor Classifier Algorithm

1-	At first, we are faced with determining n training instances that are close to the test instance coarsely.

2-	In the next phase, we select K(K<=n) nearest neighbors of the test instance from the n training instances in step 1.

3-	Then, we classify the test instance using the class labels of the K nearest neighbors.

4-	End
